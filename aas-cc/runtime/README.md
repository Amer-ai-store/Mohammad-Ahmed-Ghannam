# AAS-CC free runtime / verified operations (2026-10-27)

## Live owner dashboard

[AAS-CC Operations Console](https://aas-cc-live-command-center.floot.app/) — sign in with the dashboard's authorized Google Owner account. Use **التشغيل وGitHub والبيانات**.

## What was actually deployed

- Supabase Edge `aas-signed-local-worker-bridge` v2: RSA-3072 signed requests, 90-second timestamp checks, single-use nonce, isolated `SMOKE_TEST` / `READ_ONLY_ANALYSIS` jobs, receipts.
- Windows Server `JAWAFFASVR` worker under **NT AUTHORITY\\LOCAL SERVICE**, scheduled every 2 minutes. The task uses only outbound HTTPS, and executes the Qwen3-0.6B GGUF model via llama.cpp in an isolated folder.
- Worker signs with a **private RSA key kept on the server**; the Edge function stores only the public key. No Supabase service-role key or GitHub credential on the Windows worker.
- Supabase owner operations status via restricted `aas_cc_operation_truth()`, and existing owner-verified `aas-cc-floot-bridge` endpoints.
- GitHub Actions workflow in this branch provides credential-free bridge health, unsigned request denial, Cloudflare candidate regression, and public repository health. GitHub default CodeQL setup remains authoritative (no duplicate advanced CodeQL workflow).

## QA evidence

Two isolated jobs returned answer `4`, with verified exact-match QA:

- Manual: `eac6deb8-b70b-4207-9efc-53c9829a731d`, `QA_PASSED`, 2879 ms.
- Scheduler unattended: `651446d5-ac2b-44db-950f-0de8cd0eec42`, `QA_PASSED`, 3534 ms.

Caveat: These prove limited inference and transport ONLY. They **do not** prove canonical AAS-CC/AAS-AW tasks run end-to-end. 19 ChatGPT UI bindings remain unverified and direct ChatGPT Plus chat delivery is unsupported. The canonical dispatcher remains 503 as of this record.

## Important operational safeguards

- **NO EVIDENCE = NO DONE**, and machine ACK != completion.
- No accounting database connection or writes permitted. No external inbound port opened on JAWAFFASVR.
- Windows system clock was found ~63 minutes ahead of Supabase; the worker uses Edge server-time synchronization to sign requests, **without changing Windows time**. The host time discrepancy is an independent infrastructure finding to address via authorized time-service maintenance.
- Preserve active governance policy pins, existing coordination locks and historical receipts.
- This pilot is NOT a rollout of arbitrary model-generated commands. It does not access file shares, execute generated code or mutate financial records.
- GitHub dashboard status is **public repository Actions read-only**. Writing to GitHub from the web dashboard requires separate securely provisioned GitHub App/OAuth authorization. Do not claim GitHub write access without it.
- Fortify on Demand failures are due to absent `FOD_CLIENT_ID` / `FOD_USER` credentials (evidence: GitHub run 40390929397). CodeQL is an additive free scan candidate; Fortify has not been disabled.

## Remaining acceptance gates

1. Verify the new GitHub Actions checks on this PR.
2. Security review for the isolated worker and service account ACLs.
3. Independent QA on nontrivial read-only tasks, adverse prompt and timeout cases.
4. Governed integration with canonical dispatcher, owner/lock, policy, QA, GM review, then verifiable receipt.
5. Live validation of GitHub write scopes before adding any mutation buttons in the dashboard.

Do not report the overall program `DONE_VERIFIED` before all mandatory gates are satisfied.
